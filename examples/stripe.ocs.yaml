    # Stripe CLI reference
    
    This reference documents every command and flag available in Stripe's command-line interface.
    The Stripe CLI helps you build, test, and manage your Stripe integration right from the terminal.
    With the CLI, you can:
    - Create, retrieve, update, and delete API objects.
    - Tail API request logs in real time.
    - Securely test webhooks without relying on third-party tunneling software.
    
    Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli#install) to set up the Stripe CLI.
